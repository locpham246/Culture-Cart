Our Culture Cart project is a MERN stack delivery website built to showcase local cultural stores.

We focused on creating an intuitive platform where users can easily browse diverse products and place orders. The tech stack includes React.js on the frontend for a smooth user experience, with a Node.js/Express.js backend handling logic and API requests, all connected to a MongoDB database for efficient data management. It's a clean, functional approach to supporting local culture.
